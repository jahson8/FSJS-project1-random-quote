# Random Quote Generator

This project uses vanilla JavaScript to select a random quote from a list, display it on the screen when the Show Another Quote button is clicked; The background color of the page is changed to a random color as well. A timing function with the setInterval() method is used to print a new quote and change background color of the page at regular 10 second intervals.
